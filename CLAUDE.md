Guidelines for AI-assisted development on this project.

## Testing

Add tests for any feature you add. The project uses Vitest for testing:

- Unit tests go in `tests/unit/` mirroring the `src/` structure
- Integration tests go in `tests/integration/`
- Run tests with `npm run test`

## Commits

Commit regularly. Make small, focused commits with clear messages as you complete each logical unit of work.
